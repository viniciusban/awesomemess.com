I'm a son, daddy and husband.

Once upon a time, when I was 13, my mom brought home a second-hand TRS-80 computer, with which I learned Basic. Two years later I was working in an IBM 4341 mainframe, using professional programming languages like Cobol and Natural.

Since that time I have been a developer and got a vast experience building corporate systems to Telecom, Energy and Wharehose businesses. I've worked with character interfaces and GUI; mainframe, client/server, and the web; Cobol, Pascal, Delphi, PHP, Python and shellscript; high volume batch processing and online transactions; MVS, Windows and Unix/Linux; ADABAS, Oracle, Sybase, MySQL and Postgres. I've developed systems from scratch, integrated existing platforms and optimized processes.

I led teams and managed contracts, but I opted to return back to development. That's my profession.

I present lectures in events and teach people. I contribute to open-source software and help people in discussion lists and Telegram groups.

Afterall, I develop/deliver software and share knowledge.

Last but not least, let me give you a tip: use Python whenever possible.
